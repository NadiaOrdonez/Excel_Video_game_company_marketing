# Excel_Video_game_company_marketing
This repository showcases Excel processes to assist Game Co, a video game company with customers around the world, at planning for a marketing campaign.

## Project Overview
### Motivation
GameCo aims to leverage data for informed game development. Utilizing descriptive analysis on a video game sales dataset, the goal is to gain insights into how GameCo's new games could perform in the market.

### Objective
Plan a marketing campaign for 2017, aiming at increasing the number of units sold per game in the regions of: North America (NA), Europe (EU), Japan (JP) and Rest of the world (Others).

#### Business questions
* Did the historical sales per region remain the same over time?
* How the marketing campaign budget should be allocated?
* How to efficiently target marketing campaigns per region?
 
### Scope
Allocate marketing budget for 2017 at the regional level.

## Datasets overview
Video game sales: The dataset comprises 16588 observations related to video games, encompassing features like genre and historical regional sales spanning from 1980 to 2016.
  
## Excel processes
I conducted data cleaning, consistency checks, and basic statistical analyses on the provided dataset. Later, I pivoted the sales data at the regional level to address the stakeholders business questions and generated visuals to support my recommendations. The cleaned dataset and their associated visuals can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ciNe15Ozf200XmVtF4T1EBJIamHCf0m/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=100495170560300906732&rtpof=true&sd=true).
 
## Addressing business questions
Stakekholders were informed about the main data-driven findings with a [Power Point presentation](Final Project Presentation Nadia Ordonez.pdf). 
* Did the historical sales per region remain the same over time?
  * _Data-driven insight_: No, historical sales differ per region. In 2016, EU is the leading market.
  * _Action_: Consider historical sales to allocate a marketing budget.
* How the marketing campaign budget should be allocated?
  * _Data-driven insight_: Based on 2016 sales and previous 15 years sales due to historical fluctuations in sales.
  * _Action_: Guided by the last 15 years of sales data, allocate 69.6% of the marketing budget to EU and NA, with a slightly higher focus on NA to revive historical sales.
* How to efficiently target marketing campaigns per region?
  * _Data-driven insight_: Based on total sales per genre in the last 15 years per region.
  * _Action_: Tailor regional budgets to align with customer preferences: prioritize Action, Sports, and Shooter games globally, and emphasize Role-playing games for the Japanese market.
